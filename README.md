#Library Application

###Phase 1 
Manual addition of details

###Phase 2 
Population just ISBN number, pulling from https://platform.worldcat.org API

###Phase 3
Scan barcode, get data

Just a play thing to do some more python programming. Hoping that this can then become a platform to build with other lanuagues so I can compare and contrast.

Going to use RethinkDB as the storage, looks very interesting and connects to very easily from python
